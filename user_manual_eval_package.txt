To evaluate the models do the following:

1.	unzip the package into a folder of your choice
2.	navigate to the directory BA_evaluation_package 

##any directories given from here on are based on the current directory##

3. add your blind test data to the direcotry data and name it myBlindTestData.csv  (the file there will be overwritten)
4. open the file Evaluation.rmd in Rstudio
5. Execute the part "prepare the data for evaluation"
	a. check that the direcotry data/blindData now contains a file for each experiment that will be run
6. Execute the part "test all models"
7. The file data/resultsOnBlindData should now contain all the results from all of the experiments that were run


other useful information:
a. all the experiments (model configurations) that can be run can be found and configured in the file "modelConfiguration.csv"
b. the models that were build and can be tested are located under trainedModels
c. the vector "experimentsToRun" in line 46 configures the models that are run on the data
d. some experiments are excluded as they are likely to fail due to level differences in data that is most likely provided
e. the results that were achieved on training and test data that was not withheld is found under data/overallResults_data_JulianGruendner.csv
